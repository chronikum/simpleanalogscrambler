## Analog Scrambler

### Basic Analog Descrambler

The objective of this project is to recreate the PAL scrambler used in analog television systems. The original system functioned as a form of "encryption," where the image lines were rearranged to block unauthorized viewing of television content.

Our approach utilizes Bitmaps for simplicity, though the current implementation may not be the most efficient.

The aim is to develop a descrambler that can reorder the mixed lines into their proper sequence by analyzing their similarities.
